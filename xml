the Asiatio idea that "whoee is the sweat, ___________

sd in the ultimate result of the Emanoipa-	_

| France. Wa do not imagine that the Govern-
Intent would actively aid that revoluLon,
though it mutt be remembered that nhol*
claaae* of the smaller proprietor* were turned
at a stroke by the decree of Emancipation ,
| but it ia not impossible they would passively
watch a revolt that would then and in a
Russia composed of en absolute Tsar and
millions of small freeholders. The middle
clas’O* in Roaaia have no physical furoe with
which to rerist either the Army or the
peasants- There is 00 proof of their control
over the opinion of th* maaaet, and a terrible
and suooeasful jacqturir is at least a con-
ceivable alternative to a political revolution.
If Louis XVI. had been a mao with th* groat
qualities of the earlier Bourbons, tba French
Revolution also might have ended in that
way. Tbe Army hated the aristocratic cut* ’
much more than it hated the Throne, anti th*
emancipated peasantry would soon have
famished the Monarch, a* it has repeatedly
done sinoe that time, jnth the force to bold
down Paris Besides, where ia no Pans in
Russia, no city which by itself ia capable of
overturning a dynasty that baa ruled and hai

arning a dynasty that has ruled and hoi
uded Russia almost without a paute fur

-which is possible, of course, a* a result of
ness and indecision at the centre, and of
hock of angry surprise with which Bus-
recognise the fact that their Government

whore ia tbe ground fur thinking, as a
ber of grave pereous without doubt Mere lly
c, that an emancipated Runts would be
j weak or unambitious I Sbe might, on
ontrary, prove terribly stroug. Russian
-ala obviously believe that the newly
nebbed people would be jealous of their
igo even in the Par East, and many of
1 sugguat that the war with Japou would

but enfranchised. Eveu if that were not
aae, owing to a certain horror ot the "yel-
tevila" which has sprang up among lb*
ian masses, Russia, buinug with excite-
: with all ambitious set free and ber men
tnius, of whom she has many, at hut
ved from the heavy weight above them—
present they are tike lrogs under* flag-

or Constantinople, might rouse to cruaad-

ange of politioal possibilities, any Go-
neat of Russia, whatever tint tumo

titution, must desire to reorganise th*
f, and to obtain something of that mill-
prestige without which armies are only
stiooa of men in uuifurm. Men talk glibly
ghof the grand huauoial crash which

many millions were there in tbe treasury
